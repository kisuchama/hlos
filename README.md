hlos (actual name pending) is a JAMStack framework for mobage story databases created with the intent to fill the niche between wiki sites like Fandom and [Miraheze](https://miraheze.org), databases like [MagiCircles](https://github.com/MagiCircles), and spreadsheets pinned in Discord servers. This is an early-stage work in progress and not yet suitable for reuse.

## Organization
This story-oriented database aims to provide a quick and simple way to locate specific chapters players may want to (re)read based on criteria like the characters which appear in them and related event or card stories.

The secondary goal is to visualize character cameo trends and provide data from which players can make informed predictions on upcoming events on main story focii.
